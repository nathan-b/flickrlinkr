# flickrlinkr
A small script to create HTML from Flickr URLs

Requires node.js and node-webkit. If you don't have these things, it won't work. At all.

You can find node.js at https://nodejs.org/en/ and https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/.

Select an image in Flickr, click the arrow to export, then copy the link from "Grab link". Paste it into the first text box. 
Apply gentle pressure to the button. Bake at 175 C for 15 seconds. Your HTML will emerge piping hot and ready for consumption.
